 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       2.652   TIME= 16:08:25
 No previous ZOOM or more than five backward ZOOMs in window 1.  The     
 /ZOOM command is ignored.                                               

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       6.334   TIME= 16:12:50
 Structural elements without mid nodes usually produce much more         
 accurate results in quad or brick shape.                                

 *** WARNING ***                         CP =       6.380   TIME= 16:13:02
 Volume 1 is being meshed entirely with SOLID45 tetrahedra, which can    
 be much less accurate than bricks.  Use quadratic (10-node) tetrahedra  
 if available.

 Structural elements without mid nodes usually produce much more

 The current solution may have been produced using different model or    
 boundary condition data than is currently stored.  POST1 results may    
 be erroneous unless you perform a new solution using the stored data.
